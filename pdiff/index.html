        <h1>libgd test suite: comparing images with error tolerance</h1>
        <p>
            Unsurprisingly, there's often the need to compare images for
            equality in libgd's test suite, and the libgd test framework offers
            some helpers to make that very easy. However, there's sometimes the
            need to cater to some minor differences in the images caused by
            limited precision and rounding issues, so in addition to exact image
            comparision we need also helpers which are tolerant with regard to
            minor differences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not long ago, <a
            href="https://github.com/libgd/libgd/issues/216">Pierre
            suggested</a> to adopt <a
            href="http://pdiff.sourceforge.net/">pdiff</a> for that purpose, so
            I had a closer look at this tool and potential alternatives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Searching the web for "image similarity" and related keywords showed
            that there are a lot of tools and algorithms available for this
            purpose. It seems, though, that most of these are per se unsuitable
            for libgd's testing purposes, but rather are meant for finding
            similar images in a large collection, thereby ignoring differences
            which are inacceptable for our purposes, such as different image
            sizes/proportions, different scaling, displacement etc. We can
            reject these tools/algorithms right away.
        </p>
        <p>
            A very simple algorithm, that might be suitable for libgd's testing
            purposes is based on the Euclidean distance of the color and alpha
            channels of pixels. This is calculated as the square root of the sum
            of the squares of the individual channel differences, which can be
            compared against a given threshold. Consider, for instance, two
            pixels with <code>rgba(127, 127, 127, 63)</code> and <code>rgba(128,
            128, 128, 64)</code>. The Euclidean distance is
            <code>sqrt(1<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup> +
            1<sup>2</sup>) = sqrt(4) = 2</code>. <a
            href="#ediff.php">ediff.php</a> which employs this algorithm can be
            found in the appendix.
        </p>
        <h2 id="comparison">Comparing pdiff and ediff</h2>
        <p>
            To be able to practically compare both tools we need suitable image
            samples. We'll consider the following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Single-colored images with some errors</li>
            <li>Simple pixel displacement</li>
            <li>Differences due to lossy encoding</li>
            <li>Differences due to broken floating point calculations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We use pdiff with the default parameters using a
            <code>threshold</code> of 0. Of the other parameters most likely
            only <code>colorfactor</code> and <code>downsample</code> would be
            relevant, but we ignore these as the same techniques could be
            applied to ediff as well (and probably neither is desirable). We
            compare the results to ediff with threshold 0, 2 and 16. The
            resulting numbers are the number of pixels which are considered
            different and their percentage of all pixels of the image.
        </p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            As can be seen from the test results, pdiff does a good job
            recognizing similar images without providing false positives (what
            can be concluded from the <a href="#displacement">displacement
            test</a>). Due to its advanced algorithm it delivers better results
            than the simple ediff with a reasonable treshold of 2 with regard to
            <a href="#lossy">lossy compression</a> and <a href="#broken">broken
            floating point calculations</a>. It also delivers good results for
            <a href="#plain">slight precision/rounding errors</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, it appears that pdiff is still not good enough to test the
            results of lossy encodings; we hardly can ignore 22% or even 45% of
            pixels that would change in an automated test – actually the image
            could look <em>very</em> different. With regard to limited
            precision/ rounding issues, ediff does a comparably good job (if not
            better). Furthermore, it turned out that even the PHP implementation
            of ediff is somewhat faster than pdiff – not too important for the
            test suite, but still.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore I don't think it makes sense to add pdiff to the libgd
            test framework, particularly with regard to build, maintainance and
            license issues. ediff doesn't have these issues and also does a decent
            job. Unfortunately, neither tool solves all issues …

            The following PHP script verifies the similarity of PNG images by
            comparing the Euclidean pixel distance against a threshold
            (tolerance), and reports the number of pixels that exceed this
            threshold. Note that the script also can test for exact image
            identity, if <code>0</code> is passed as threshold.
